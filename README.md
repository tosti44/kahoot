This is a Python script that uses some of kitty tools code to get answers and then give u an option between showing the answers and automatically answering the questions when you press N, you can change the button in code. you need the coordinates of where the colors like red blue green and yellow are and put them in the coordinates tab at the top [it might already work just try]

You do need to install some stuff there is a file that downloads all and some down here:
firstly you need python(in microsoft store), git(winget install git.git), pyautogui (pip install pyautogui), keyboard(pip install keyboard)

use git clone https://github.com/tosti44/kahoot (to download)
use cd kahoot
use python install-kahoot.py
afterwards use cd Ez-Tosti then use python script.py
when done you can choose between the one that automatically answers the questions or the one that just shows the answers [if u want to use the automated option you might have to change the coordinates in the code

that should be all:)
